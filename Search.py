def astar(startnode, endnode, heuristic):

    Perform an A* search on a graph.

    startnode and endnode are node-like objects, which have .name and
    .neighbors attributes. .neighbors is a sequence of 2-tuples
    (node, distance).

    heuristic is a function that accepts an object of the type of startnode
    and endnode and returns a value with a total ordering.
