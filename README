===========================


Running the program
--------------------

1. From the console 

To execute the console program, run at the command line:

$ python main.py <locations.txt> <connections.txt> <start> <end> [<blocked> [<blocked> ...]]

If there is no valid route from the start to the end without going
through a blocked city, the program will throw an exception.

2. Running the GUI

Execute the following command:

$ python3 GUI.py


Using the GUI
-------------

Example program run:

1. Load the program GUI
2. From "File->Open locations file..." select the locations file to use
3. From "File->Open connections file..." select the connections file to use
4. Select the origin city from the "Start city" dropdown menu
5. Select the destination city from the "End city" dropdown menu
6. Click on one of the cities to mark it as 'blocked' (color changes to black)
6. From "Search" menu select "Start search by distance"
7. Click the next step button (arrow) to run the search
8. Continue clicking the next step button until the search ends
   (i.e. either the end city is found or no route from start city to end city could be found)

Notes
-----
The play button (triangle) will run the search until the end city is found or no route from
the start city to the end city can be found.

Clicking a city will toggle it from 'blocked' to 'unblocked' and vice versa.

Start and end cities should be set using the corresponding option menus.
Start and end cities cannot be set to 'blocked'.
Start and end cities should not be the same.

The stop search button will end the current search, and allow the user to
select new blocked cities. The user then has to restart the search from the
beginning.
