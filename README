To Execute:
-----------

I have included two versions of this program: one works in Python 2.7, the
other in Python 3. Both should work equally well; the Python 3 version was my
original, with the Python 2 version as a backport.

To execute the program, run at the command line:

python main.py <locations.txt> <connections.txt> <start> <end> [<blocked> [<blocked> ...]]

If there is no valid route from the start to the end without going through a blocked city,
the program will throw an exception.
